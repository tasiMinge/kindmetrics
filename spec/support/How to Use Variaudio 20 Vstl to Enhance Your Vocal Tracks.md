## What is Variaudio 2.0 Vstl?
 
Variaudio 2.0 Vstl is an updated version of the original Variaudio plugin that was released in 2009. It is a pitch correction and editing tool that works on monophonic audio signals, such as vocals, bass, or saxophone. It allows you to adjust the pitch, timing, and formant of each note in a graphical interface, similar to Melodyne or Auto-Tune.
 
Variaudio 2.0 Vstl has several features that make it stand out from other pitch correction plugins. For example, it has a smart algorithm that automatically detects the pitch and segments of your audio, saving you time and effort. It also has a micro pitch control that lets you fine-tune the pitch of each note by cents or semitones. Moreover, it has a formant shift function that allows you to change the timbre and character of your voice without affecting the pitch.
