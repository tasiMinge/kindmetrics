# Nayl al-Awtaar: A Classic Work of Fiqh by Imam ash-Shawkaanee
 
Nayl al-Awtaar is a famous work of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) by Imam Muhammad bin Ali ash-Shawkaanee (1250H), a Yemeni scholar who was well-versed in various Islamic sciences. The book is a commentary on al-Muntaqa, a collection of hadiths related to fiqh, compiled by Majd ad-Deen ibn Taymiyyah, the grandfather of the renowned scholar Ibn Taymiyyah. Nayl al-Awtaar covers various topics of fiqh, such as purification, prayer, zakat, fasting, hajj, marriage, divorce, inheritance, jihad, oaths, vows, and more. It is based on the Quran and the Sunnah, and also cites the opinions of the four major schools of fiqh (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali), as well as other scholars such as Ibn Hazm, al-Qurtubi, Ibn Qudamah, and others.

Nayl al-Awtaar is highly recommended by many scholars for its comprehensiveness, authenticity, and clarity. It is considered one of the best works of fiqh in the history of Islam. It has been published in various editions and languages, such as Arabic, Urdu, English, and others. Some editions have also added annotations and verification of the hadiths according to modern standards of hadith criticism. For example, the Egyptian edition has used the grading of al-Albani for the hadiths, and has also added vowel marks to the text for easier reading. The Saudi edition has been verified and authenticated by Sheikh Muhammad Subhi Hasan Hallaq, a Yemeni specialist of the works of ash-Shawkaanee. It also has a separate volume for indexes and references.
 
Nayl al-Awtaar is a valuable source of knowledge and guidance for anyone who wants to learn about the rulings and evidences of fiqh in Islam. It is also a useful reference for scholars and students who want to compare and contrast different opinions and approaches to fiqh. It is a masterpiece that reflects the erudition and piety of Imam ash-Shawkaanee, who was one of the most prominent scholars of his time.

Some of the features of Nayl al-Awtaar are:
 
- It follows a systematic and logical order in presenting the topics of fiqh, starting from the most important and fundamental ones, such as the pillars of Islam, and then moving on to the subsidiary and detailed ones, such as the manners of eating and drinking.
- It provides a comprehensive and balanced view of the different opinions and evidences of the scholars of fiqh, without being biased or fanatical towards any particular school or group. It also shows respect and courtesy to the scholars who held different views, and does not resort to harsh or derogatory language.
- It explains the reasons and wisdom behind the rulings of fiqh, and shows how they are derived from the Quran and the Sunnah. It also highlights the benefits and objectives of the Shariah, and how they serve the interests of humanity and society.
- It cites relevant verses from the Quran and hadiths from the Sunnah to support the rulings of fiqh, and also mentions the narrators and sources of the hadiths. It also uses other types of evidence, such as consensus (ijma'), analogy (qiyas), public interest (maslahah), custom (urf), and others.
- It contains many useful and interesting information and facts that are not commonly found in other books of fiqh, such as historical events, biographies of scholars, linguistic analysis, scientific discoveries, and more.

Nayl al-Awtaar is a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom that can enrich one's understanding and practice of Islam. It is a book that deserves to be studied and appreciated by Muslims of all backgrounds and levels.
